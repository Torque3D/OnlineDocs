Adding A New Player - TODO
*****************************


Introduction
==============
One of the first things you will want to do after you have become familiar with T3D is to change the player character model. This can simply be achieved by using Torque 3D's powerful World Editor and its provided game editing tool set.

In this Tutorial we are going to take a step by step look at how to change the default player character from the Gideon model to the BoomBot model. These steps can then be easily applied to your own rigged character model for use in your T3D project. We will explore how to change the players characteristics through the use of the datablock properties and how to spawn this new player into the game , and all this can be done without touching any scripting thanks to T3D's great game editing WYSIWYG tool set.

**Topics we will look at in this tutorial:**

* Create a new Player Datablock
* Changing the player model
* Changing Player properties
* Spawning a new player


Setup
========

We will start off by opening the Deathball Desert Torque 3D project from the provided toolbox, but first I would advise you to back up this example project.

#. The example project is located in the Torque 3D Pro 1.1 \Examples folder. Make a backup copy of the FPS Example folder by copying it to a backup folder.

#. Launch the T3D tool box.
