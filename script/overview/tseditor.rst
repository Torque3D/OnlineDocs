TorqueScript Editors - TODO
****************************

TorqueScript files are essentially text files. This means you have several editors to choose from. Some users prefer to use the stock OS text editors: Notepad on Windows or Text Edit on OS X. Others will use their programming IDEs (Interactive Development Environments), such as Visual Studio for Windows or Xcode on OS X. Third party applications are the most popular choice:

On Windows
===========

**Torsion** - Torsion is undeniably the best TorqueScript IDE was developed by Torque veterans Sickhead Games. If you are developing on Windows, this is the first thing you should purchase after Torque 3D.

Torsion is a powerful development environment for creating TorqueScript based games and mods.

No other editor offers this level of quality and functionality:

* Integrated "One Click" script debugging.
* Full control over script execution via step and break commands.
* Advanced editor features like code folding, line wrapping, auto-indent, column marker, automatic bracket matching, and visible display of tabs and spaces.
* Go to line and text searching.
* ScriptSense updated dynamically as you type.
* Customizable syntax highlighting for TorqueScript.
* Unlimited undo/redo buffer.
* Code browser window for exploring both engine exports and script symbols in your project.

On OS X
=========

**Xcode** - https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ - Xcode is Apple's premier development environment for Mac OS X. If you plan on modifying Torque 3D's source code, you will need this anyway. Most developers at GarageGames use Xcode to modify their scripts on a Mac.

**Text Edit** - This is the OS X default text editor. With no bells or whistles, this is not the best editor you can use on OS X, but it is free and ships with the OS.

**Smultron** - https://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/ - Smultron is a text editor written in Cocoa for Mac OS X Leopard 10.5 which is designed to be both easy to use and powerful.

Cross-platform
===============

**TIDE** - http://torqueide.sourceforge.net/ - Torque Integrated Development Environment (TIDE) is a free, cross-platform IDE for Torque Game Engine scripting by Paul Dana and Stefan Moises. It is implemented in Java as a plug-in suite for the jEdit text editor and contains plug-ins for syntax highlighting, function browsing, script debugging, etc.

**Atom** - https://atom.io - Is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core—a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.

**UltraEdit** - https://www.ultraedit.com/ - UltraEdit is a powerful disk-based text editor, programmer's editor, and hex editor that is used to edit TorqueScript, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, Perl, C/C++, and a multitude of other coding/programming languages.
